        <p> This first project was from my Introduction to Programming class, and the task we were given at the most basic level was to build a game. We had to build the game from scratch using YoYo Games' GameMaker Studio 1.4 engine, using the skills we had acquired from lessons in the class. All assets were made from scratch too, so coding was only half of the project.</p>
